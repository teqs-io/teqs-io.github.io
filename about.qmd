# About TEQS

## Mission & Vision

Our mission is to develop open-source, cutting-edge systems for 
high-fidelity terrain and environment analysis, leveraging 
transformer-based geospatial pipelines, multi-modal data fusion, 
and HPC integrations.

## History & Origins

TEQS was inspired by leading arXiv research on remote sensing, 
foundation models, and advanced machine learning approaches 
for environmental data.

## Team

Our core team spans environmental scientists, ML engineers, and HPC experts, 
collaborating with academic institutions and open-source communities worldwide.
